## Reporting bugs

It seems helpful that the match is exported and attached to the bug report,
so that the case can be more easily reproduced and debugged.

## Exporting and importing match

### Exporting match

```js
copy(app.exportMatch())
```

### Importing match

```js
app.importMatch(/* EXPORTED MATCH */)
```
